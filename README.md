# Graph_processing
# Large Scale Supervised Link prediction with Spark Graph libraries and Spark MLlib

Aims

1) To evaluate how the system performs link prediction on spark graph libraries and Spark MLLib
2) Comparison of frameworks.(Neo4j and GraphX).
3) Categorisation of features based on complexity and their contribution
4) Considerations on how to improve temporal aspects for working with graphs
5) Comparision of classifiers and Machine learning models for the link prediction between two authors
